# AI on the Edge

This repository contains learnings on **containerizing Azure AI models** and running them in local or hybrid environments. This is a **living repository**, meaning it will be updated over time as I gain more experience with containerizing specific AI models.

- The `src/` folder contains quickstart examples for Azure AI models, including installation instructions (if applicable).  
- The `docs/` folder contains in-depth learnings, organized by Azure AI service.

## General Learnings

Microsoft provides official [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/containers/container-faq) on how to containerize Azure AI services. 

This repository complements that with hands-on insights and practical examples.
